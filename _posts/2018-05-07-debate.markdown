Competition is unique in that it allows people to connect with one another even though they have never done the same activities. I have several friends on the debate team at AU, and even though I have never debated and they didn't play the same sports I did in high school, we have been able to connect over the same kind of experiences.

Just as they might disagree with a bad judgment, I might get upset over a bad foul. We both understand the feeling of wanting the person you are facing to fail, while also deeply respecting them and their skill. The idea that we can share these feelings is why I consider competition of any kind a activity unto itself, with many subsections for every imaginable game or sport.
