title: Captain Sonar Article

I liked this [article](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/captain-sonar-someone-finally-made-a-great-8p-board-game/) I found on Captain Sonar. There are very few 8-player games that actually make gameplay interesting for every player. The fact that the most important player isn't the team leader is an interesting dynamic that sounds fun to explore.
