This [podcast](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/in-the-same-ballpark/) on the design of ballparks is almost a year old, but I just heard it recently.

Stadiums are often designed to fit the most possible seats, but going forward it will be interesting if designers take the potential impacts of designing smaller stadiums and ballpark on both the games being played and the city and society that they are nested in.
