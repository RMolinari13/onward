title: Park wins Epee gold
---

This [bout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8A51o1ipPk) is from the 2016 Olympics, but I can across it during my fencing class.

This is one of the greatest sports moments I have ever seen. The perseverence that Park shows in making this comeback is incredible. As opposed to foil and sabre, the entire body is target in Epee. This means that any touch over the last five points would have cost him the gold.

I can barely imagine the mental toughness it takes to maintain his composure given those odds.
