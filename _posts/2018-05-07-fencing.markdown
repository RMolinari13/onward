title: Fencing

It is incredible how even the smallest exposure to a sport can give you a newfound appreciation for the skill it takes to play.

Taking fencing this term has been super fun, but what I find most amazing is that even with the minimal experience I have, I can already guage what is actually happening during a bout much better than I could before I took the class. Actions that looked miniscule before I now recognize as being incredibly important. I wonder what it would be like to see this game from the perspeoctive of someone who has fenced their whole life.
