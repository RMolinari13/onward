[Mafia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Woe0-dY_QI) is an incredibly fun game that requires no pieces, dice or board, just about 15 people. The object of the game is for the players to deduce who amongst them are mafia members before the mafia eliminates all other players.

I believe Mafia is one of the best designed group games. The social interactions that it forces are incredibly interesting, and the rules are simple enough that new players can pick it up rather quickly. The simple rules also allow for a lot of tweaking if players want, so players can design their own versions of the game based on their previous experiences.
