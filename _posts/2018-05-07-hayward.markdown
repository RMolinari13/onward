title: Hayward on Gaming

Another older [article](https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/gordon-hayward-jazz-video-games) that I like.

People don't think of sports and video games having much overlap, but Hayward explains how there are atributes of both that can draw the same people to them. When games are well-designed, they allow people to hone a certain set of skills for no other purpose that to be better than other people honing the same skills. As technology evolves and videogames become more precise and purposely skill-based, it will be interesting to see if society starts to value electronic competition equally with physical competition.
