title: Logos

I found this older [article](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/05/clippers-logo-bad-agua-caliente-nba) on simple changes to fix some team logos.

I don't agree with every change they suggest, but what's interesting to me is how reluctant teams are to make very simple changes to make their brands more visually appealing. It is clear from their reluctance that the benefits of the design come from society's association with it, not how well designed it is.
