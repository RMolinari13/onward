title: NBA Speed

As I was watching the NBA playoffs, it occurred to me how much more action I was watching, in a shorter amount of time, than when I watch baseball of football.

Both of the other two major sports could use some tweaking to improve the pace of play, and the NFL in particular really suffers from back to back commercial breaks.

It will be interesting to see going forward if the NFL's popularity declines if games remain this sluggish.
