title: NBA Speed
---

As I was watching the NBA playoffs, it occurred to me how much more action I was watching, in a shorter amount of time, than when I watch baseball of football.

Both of the other two major sports could use some tweaking to improve the pace of play, and the NFL in particular really suffers from back to back commercial breaks.

The NFL was the first sport to 'modernize' the viewer experience, bringing in instant replay, video reviews, and extensive halftime shows. These changes propelled it to the top of American sports, but now that other sports have caught up, it will be interesting to see going forward if the NFL's popularity declines if games remain this sluggish, or if the NFL will try to speed up the pace of play and change the design of its viewer experience.
