title: City Uniforms
---

This year, the NBA added new 'City' [uniforms](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21892679/nike-unveils-their-final-crop-new-uniforms-hand-grades) to their jersey rotation.

These jeresy designs are really interesting to me because of the different ways they call upon societal influences in the design. Some focus on the sports culture of the city, like Portland's Rip City design, while others, like Memphis, reference significant historical events. I know the fans response in Portland was very favorable to these, so I wonder how other fanbases around the league responded.
