Because the North was worth 5 armies a turn and only had 4 points of entrance, the game was highly centralized about denying each other the North in the standard game.

The special rules were not much of an improvement. While the objective system is a cool idea, the scaling of the gold objective to the rest makes them too easy to achieve, centralizing the game even further around the North and it's incredible resource production.

Overall, the game has some fun ideas, but could use a redesign to balance out the power of the North.
