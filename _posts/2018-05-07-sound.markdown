title: Sound Design

Another older 99% Invisible [podcast](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-sound-of-sports/) I came across.

This episode really made me think of how seamless truly excellent design is. People don't generally notice sound design in sports because broadcasts sound how we expect sports to sound. Only when something truly jarring happens, such as the vuvuzelas, do we take note of how our viewer experience is designed.
