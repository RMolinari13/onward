title: Sports Bra

I've been listening to old editions of 99% Invisible lately, and I came across this [podcast](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-athletic-brassiere/) about the design of sports bras. It's interesting how quickly new materials were developed and implemented to meet society's needs, and how those changes have further shaped culture in regards to women's sports.
