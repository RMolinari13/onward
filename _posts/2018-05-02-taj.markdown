This [post](https://bignokh.com/2018/04/11/no-3-cinderella-run-of-all-time-taj-at-genesis-2/) caught my attention. 

As someone who plays Melee and follows the competetive scene, it is amazing to me that someone could reach winners finals of a large tournament and be content with just making it there. Most top players are hyper competetive, and so Taj's response to his run is definitely a change of pace.
