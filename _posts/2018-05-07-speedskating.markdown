This [article](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/team-usa-speed-skating-uniform-crotches-winter-olympics-2018) about the U.S. speedskating team uniforms was interesting to me because it shows how much society often focuses on the aesthetics of design rather than the function. There are very good reasons for the uniforms to be designed as they are, especially for a sport that uses technology to maximize efficiency, but most people are too distracted by the visual to notice.
