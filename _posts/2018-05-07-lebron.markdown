[Insane](https://streamable.com/phjff)

I don't want this to turn into a highlight blog, but I wanted to use this dunk to talk about how insane it is that Lebron James is having the season he is having at age 33. Most players are eyeing retirement at this age, and instead Lebron is still producing at near his career averages, and is currently sweeping the top seed in the East.
