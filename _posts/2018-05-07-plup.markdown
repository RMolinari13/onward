This [article](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/22178949/genesis-plup-claims-genesis-crown) recaps Plup's incredible win at Genesis this January.

This was one of the most exciting events I've every watched. It shows how while continued dominance by a few players can get boring, it is all the more exciting when new players begin ot take over.
