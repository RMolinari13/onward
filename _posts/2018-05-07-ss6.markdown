title: Smash Summit 6

The Melee invatational [Smash Summit 6](https://smash.gg/tournament/smash-summit-6/events/melee-singles/brackets/254732) happened this weekend. It was won by Mew2king, in what is easily the biggest victory of his long career.

The top level of Melee is probably more competetive now than is has ever been. The top 6 players (Hbox, Armada, Mango, Leffen, Mew2king, and Plup) are all serious threats to win every tournament they attend. Following the last two yeas of dominance by Armada and Hbox, this is a very refreshing change to the top meta.
